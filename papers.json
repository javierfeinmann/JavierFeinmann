        "text": "In this paper we study formal workers receiving part of their salary <i>off the books</i>, which we refer to as ``payments under the table''. We conducted a large survey among Brazilian formal workers to understand the extent and mechanics of this type of informality. We find that payments ``under the table'' are widespread, sizeable, and proportionally larger for higher income workers. Arrangements involving these payments are typically suggested by the employer, with payments being typically made with cash or virtual payments, and are more widespread in industries with higher shares of informal workers. In addition, we study wage reporting dynamics around the ceiling of employee social security contributions, which can create incentives to collude between employers and employees to underreport wages. We find several patterns of earnings reporting that are consistent with employer and employees engaging in payments ``under the table''. Finally, we conduct an information experiment highlighting the benefits linked to reported wages, and analyze the effect on the intention to engage in collusive underreporting under the light of an intra-firm bargaining model.",
