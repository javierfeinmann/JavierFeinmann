        "text": "In this paper we combine novel data on the universe of entrepreneurs between 2000 and 2022 with standarized tests, college application and the census of higher education in Brazil to study how attending different majors affect the probability of becoming an entrepreneur. Moreover, we differentiate between the type of firms that these entrepreneurs set up. We characterize firms based on their survival rate, industry and employment creation. Finally, we explore the role of networks formed in college to create partnerships and owner-manager relationship in the future.",

We explore the role of informal employment and self-employment as alternative activities when there is high demand for labor flexbility. Finally, we use a regression discontinuity design on the maternity leave extension to understand how these type of policies affect the motherhood gap and the alternative margin of responses.",

        "subtitle": "Before 2017 in Brazil, people could get a high school degree by achieving certain scores in ENEM (standarized tests). About 10% of ENEM takers took the exam to get the diploma. We exploit the discontinuity generated by the cutoff to understand the intrinsic value of the diploma. We find positive effects on college attendance which do not fully close more than five years later. Moreover, we study the labor market consequences in terms of formal employments, entrepreneurship, self-employment and informality for different time windows. This allows us to characterize the dynamics behind the effect of getting a high school diploma.",

We tackle three main questions: 1) How property taxation/assessments vary across race and gender in a city and what are the drivers of such patterns? 2) What are the consequences of property taxation in terms of labor market, inequality and enterpreneurship? 3) To what extent do we observe tax evasion in property transactions?",
