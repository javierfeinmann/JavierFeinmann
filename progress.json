We tackle three main questions: 1) How property taxation/assessments vary across race and gender in a city and what are the drivers of such patterns? 2) What are the consequences of property taxation in terms of labor market, inequality and enterpreneurship? 3) To what extent do we observe tax evasion in property transactions?",
