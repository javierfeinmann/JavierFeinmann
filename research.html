                                    <i>Funded by Center of Equitable Growth and Center of Effective Global Action (CEGA)</i> <p>In this paper we study formal workers receiving part of their salary <i>off the books</i>, which we refer to as ``payments under the table''. We conducted a large survey among Brazilian formal workers to understand the extent and mechanics of this type of informality. We find that payments ``under the table'' are widespread, sizeable, and proportionally larger for higher income workers. Arrangements involving these payments are typically suggested by the employer, with payments being typically made with cash or virtual payments, and are more widespread in industries with higher shares of informal workers. In addition, we study wage reporting dynamics around the ceiling of employee social security contributions, which can create incentives to collude between employers and employees to underreport wages. We find several patterns of earnings reporting that are consistent with employer and employees engaging in payments ``under the table''. Finally, we conduct an information experiment highlighting the benefits linked to reported wages, and analyze the effect on the intention to engage in collusive underreporting under the light of an intra-firm bargaining model.

                                    <i>Funded by Berkeley Opportunity Lab</i><br><p>In this project we study how entrepreneurs leverage their network to hire workers for their startup
                                    firms. We want to understand who are the workers that entrepreneurs hire, which entrepreneurs
                                    hire former coworkers and how hiring from their network influences firms’ outcomes. We document that former coworker of entrepreneurs represent around 15% of the initial cohort
                                    of workers in startup firms. We show that, consistent both with a story of private information
                                    and match effects between entrepreneurs and workers, former coworkers earn around 10% more
                                    and are more likely to have longer tenure than other employees in startups. Then, we show that
                                    startups that hire at least one former coworker of their founders are 8% more likely to survive by
                                    year 5 and 10% larger than those who do not hire former coworkers.
                                    We model the decision of the entrepreneur to hire a former coworker. This choice depends on both
                                    the utility that the entrepreneur obtains from the worker, but also from the wages that they have to
                                    pay to hire them. Thus, for example, an entrepreneur that did not know high quality workers will
                                    choose not to hire them because they will not be good workers in their new firm, but at the same
                                    time, an entrepreneur that has a high quality network might not be able to hire former coworker
                                    because the wage they have to pay is too high.
                                    Modelling this decision allow us to construct control functions that in turn, provide us an adequate
                                    estimate of the effects of how hiring former coworkers affects startup outcomes and disentangle
                                    if the patterns observed in the data are due to unobserved entrepreneurs’ characteristics or due to
                                    actual effects of the workers’ quality on firms’ performance. [ <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qbeqgfw4v1n0iv2/coworkers_and_firm_performance.pdf?dl=0">Slides</a> ]</p>

                                    <p>In this project we study the effects of lawsuits related to sexual assaults in different labor market
                                        outcomes. From the firm perspective, we explore whether being sued affects the probability of
                                        hiring women the year after and how it depends on the owners’ gender. From the worker’s per-
                                        spective, we study the effect of winning a case on her future labor market outcomes. Moreover, we
                                        explore how suing may help her friend to report gender violence and what are the mechanisms in
                                        place. For example, we can differentiate whether coworkers just update their probability of win-
                                        ning a case versus they get information on where to report or what lawyers to hire. Finally, as a
                                        more ambitious project, we plan to get the pdf of the cases related to sexual assaults to recover
                                        the date in which the sexual assault took place. This is a crucial to study a key question in the
                                        literature of gender violence: what are the effects of being sexually assault in the workplace?. To deal
                                        with the selection problem due to the fact that we only observe women who report cases we will
                                        follow two strategies. First, we will model the selection into reporting, following a similar strategy
                                        than in the main proposal in this application. Second, we will run a comprehensive survey among
                                        female formal employees in Brazil to re-weight the demographics in our estimates such that we
                                        make the results representative of the population.</p>

                                    <p>We study a reform that aimed to curb the influence of government suppliers on public contract-
                                        ing by forbidding corporate campaign contributions and limiting the expenditures that Brazilian
                                        mayoral candidates can incur during their campaigns. Our first contribution is to uncover to what
                                        extent corporations were able to bypass the new electoral rule through owners’ campaign con-
                                        tributions. We find that at least 8,174 (out of 126,887) government suppliers remained connected
                                        through owners’ donations. Moreover, we leverage a regression discontinuity and an instrumental
                                        variable design to study the impact of cap strictness on contributions composition and project exe-
                                        cution. We find evidence that this aspect of the reform effectively reduced private influence in gov-
                                        ernment contracting by reducing the number of corporate contributors for candidate’s campaigns, which translated into downstream outcomes on contracting with fewer delays, cost overruns, and
                                        fewer contracts awarded to connected suppliers. However, we find that the effects are limited
                                        to municipalities with higher levels of inequality, suggesting that limiting campaign expenditures
                                        might effectively curb clientelism in highly unequal societies.</p>
