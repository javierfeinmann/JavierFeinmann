        "text": "We study formal workers who receive part of their salary <i>off the books</i>, which we refer to as ''payments under the table'' (PUTs). First, we present findings from an original representative survey of formal workers in Brazil to document novel empirical facts about the scope and economic significance of PUTs. A quarter of formal employees admit to receiving PUTs for about 20% of their wages, with higher-wage workers evading a larger share of their total wages. This translates into significant revenue losses for the government, totaling 4.7% of labor income taxes. Second, we develop a stylized model to illuminate how the incentives of both employers and workers influence PUTs. Lastly, leveraging rich administrative data and several complementary research designs, we provide empirical evidence on how these incentives drive changes in PUTs from both sides of the collusion. On the employer side, we use novel data on PUT-related labor lawsuits matched to employer-employee records to show that employers increase the reported wages of other employees in the firm by 1% in response to a PUT-related lawsuit. We show these effects are driven by higher lawsuit risk. On the employee side, we document bunching in reported wages just below the social security ceiling. Below the ceiling, additional reporting increases pension benefits, making PUTs costlier, while above the ceiling, these benefits max out. This indicates employers adjust PUTs to align with the employees' benefit threshold. Overall, these findings challenge existing assumptions about the effectiveness of third-party reporting and underscore the need for tailored policy tools to address tax evasion in developing countries."

        "text": "We use population-wide administrative micro-data to provide new estimates of income inequality and effective tax rates by income groups in Brazil, capturing all income and all tax payments. Our data allow us to link businesses to their owners and thus to allocate business income and associated taxes to the corresponding individual firm owners. We provide sharp upward revisions to official inequality estimates: the top 1% earns 27.4% of total income in 2019, one of the highest level recorded in the world. The tax system, which relies heavily on consumption taxes, is regressive: while the average tax rate in the economy is 42.5%, this rate falls to 20.6% for million-dollar earners (roughly the top 0.01% of the distribution), due to the non-taxation of dividends and provisions that reduce corporate tax liabilities. We provide evidence suggesting that inequality in developing countries may be systematically underestimated, as even in Brazil—where dividends are untaxed, and hence incentives to retain income within companies are limited—attributing profits to business owners substantially raises income inequality."

        "text": "How does higher education shape social mobility in countries where elite colleges are public and tuition-free? Using linked microdata spanning several decades, we follow Brazilian high school graduates through college and into the labor market to study income segregation, mobility, and the distributional incidence of public spending.  We first show that large gaps in test scores across income groups explain the substantial income segregation in public colleges; conditional on scores, public admissions are income-neutral. We then combine colleges' income composition with graduates' earnings ranks ten years later to construct college-level mobility rates. Elite public colleges have relatively low mobility rates because the sharp fall in the enrollment of disadvantaged students outweighs higher mobility. Using college-level financial data, we document that per-student government transfers are much higher at elite publics, rendering a very regressive picture of the public expenditure in higher education: the top 10% receiving 6.75 times more than the bottom 10%. Finally, exploiting differential exposure to a nationwide affirmative-action reform, we quantify causal effects on income composition in each college tier. We find that, in the absence of the policy, the top 20% would receive 6pp more of total government transfers to public universities."

        "text": "This paper investigates the effects of increasing the information that lenders have about borrowers on their credit access, default rates, and entrepreneurial activity. Partnering with the largest credit bureau in Brazil, we explore a unique policy that increased the information available for credit bureaus to construct credit scores. Changes in the credit allocation are consistent with a simple conceptual framework of decision-making under imperfect information that rationalizes how new credit scores built with more information should affect credit allocation. This includes not only increasing credit for those who are suggested to be more creditworthy given the new information but also reflects the increase in the precision of the signal, widening the credit distribution. We show that credit allocated by the policy has substantially lower default rates than the counterfactual credit without the policy, but reallocation increased credit inequality, also causing an increase in the racial gap in credit access. We then explore effects beyond the credit market by investigating if the policy affected entrepreneurial activity. We find no effect on firm creation but evidence of better (worse) outcomes of firms created by positively (negatively) exposed individuals. These effects translate into an improvement in the average firm quality of new cohorts of entrepreneurs, suggesting productivity gains from the reallocation of credit."

        "text": "This paper studies the effect of prohibiting the use of cash for wage disbursements on labor markets in developing countries. We study a reform in Uruguay that mandated wage payments to be disbursed using only electronic methods. Using a difference-in-difference approach based on sector-level cash intensity prior to the reform, our results indicate that firms in high cash intensity sectors are significantly more likely to discontinue formal activities post-reform. Active firms show a slight reduction in the number of employees and an increase in repoted wages. These results are driven by low productivity firms. Complementary results using survey data indicate an increase in informal employment and a decrease in collusive underreporting of earnings partially explain these results. Overall, results suggest that, while eliminating cash for wage payments enhances tax compliance among formal workers, it may also shift some economic activity into full informality, offsetting the revenue gains from improved payroll tax compliance."
